We are a non-profit organization helping members to create lower cost, more successful Odoo solutions faster, with the Persian support, easy access to high quality apps and open upgrades. 

Our members are Odoo developers, functional integrators, consultants, and community users and clients. The OCA allows you, as a member or contributor, to work independently in a community of peers who see you, support you and learn from you. We allow organizations to show their support for the Odoo open source community. 

Join us, and be part of a global network fostering open source excellence.
